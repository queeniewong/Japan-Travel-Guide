			<h2>Kiyomizu Temple</h2>
			<p>
				Kiyomizudera is one of the famous spot in Kyoto.
				It is well known because of its wooden stage which is 13 meters above the hill.
				You can enjoy the wonderful scenery there. It is a very good place to enjoy the
				 cherry blossom and red leaves during Spring and Autumn.

			<h2>Fushimi Inari Shrine</h2>
			<p>
				Fushimi Inari Shrine is a Shinto shrine located at Mount Inari in southern Kyoto.
				In the past, Mount Inari is a holy place. Since ancient times,Fushimi Inari Shrine 
				is mainly for worship the Inari God and agriculture use. <br> <br>
				
				Starting from Edo period, Kyoto people has a custom. Peolpe will donate a torii
				gate to show the respect of  god. Therefore, there are thousands of torii 
				gates around the Fushimi Inari Shrine. Also, it is famous of "Thousands of 
				Torii Gate" around the world. <br> <br>
				 
				I am in love with this place because of the torii gate. When you walk along,
				it is just like walking inside a red tunnel. It is really a beautiful place 
				which you must go once! Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to walk through 
				the whole torii gate route last time. I will definitely go here again in the future.
				 <br> <br>
				As those torii gates were built along the Mount Inari, it leads to the wooden 
				forest. It is recommended to go there in the morning. Otherwise, it might be 
				scary to walk under the torri gate at night. Also, the whole torii gate route is 
				around 2 kilometers and takes you 2 hours to finish it. For those would like to visit it, 
				you should estimate your visiting time carefully.  <br> <br>
				
				<strong> Enjoy the leisure walk under thousands torii gates! </strong>
